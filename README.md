# PyECA (Ecrypted Chat App)
## 🪬 Introduction
Ever wanted to dive into the role of the main character in Mr.Robot TV show? Me too. So I first of all, you will need a secure chat application to talk with your hacking buddies. 

The purpose of this project was to create a chat application on working on __IP/TCP sockets__ that utilizes __RSA/AES__ encryption, __digital signining + salt__, and other feautures, such as __GUI__. Originally, I was insipired to create a secure chat app that was used by the protagonist in Mr.Robot TV show:![image](https://github.com/AdrianGuretto/PyECA/assets/102734242/6cd1b4c0-e027-4120-9472-c064bcb83da6)
